        How I started Programming.
I started playing around with making websites in 2018, using inspect element to see how things worked and reacted to each other. In early 2019, I then started using a drag and drop javascript game engine called Scratch to make very basic web games. Eventually I found youtube tutorials on how to make a basic website with html and css in 2020 and made A few very simple personal websites. In late 2020 I learned how to use most of javascript, and started to learn Node.js along with how web servers worked. My first Node.js project had been a very basic forum board to send messages on. After that I wanted to make something bigger and better, so I took on the challenge that is creating a fully functional social media. Lately, I have also started making other small games with engines such as Godot and Unity to expand my knowledge on how programming languages work and are interpreted.
